# Resume PDF Placeholder

To add your resume PDF:

1. Place your resume PDF file in this `public` folder
2. Name it `abhisek_resume.pdf`
3. The download button in the About section will automatically link to it

If you want to use a different filename:
- Update the link in `components/About.tsx`
- Change `href="/abhisek_resume.pdf"` to your filename

Current resume location should be: `/public/abhisek_resume.pdf`
